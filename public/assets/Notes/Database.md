# ‚ùì What is SQL?

**Answer:**  
SQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming language used to interact with databases. üóÉÔ∏è It is the standard language for querying, inserting, updating, and managing data stored in relational databases.

## üìö Real-World Example: Library Analogy

Think of a **database** as a **üìñ library**, and **SQL** as the language used to communicate with the **üë©‚Äçüíº librarian (Database Management System)**.

- A **üéì student or üë®‚Äçüè´ teacher** comes to the librarian and asks for a specific **üìò book**.
- The **librarian** searches for the book in the library‚Äôs catalog (database) using that request.
- Once found, the librarian **retrieves** the book and **hands it over** to the student/teacher.

This is similar to how SQL works:

- The **user** sends an SQL query (like `SELECT * FROM Books WHERE Title = 'Database Systems'`)  
- The **DBMS** processes this query  
- It **returns the result** to the user ‚Äî in this case, the information about the requested book üìÑ.

## ‚ùó Why we use SQL?

SQL is used for:

- üîç **Data Retrieval**: To fetch specific data from a database.
- ‚úçÔ∏è **Data Manipulation**: To insert, update, or delete data in a database.
- üèóÔ∏è **Data Definition**: To create, modify, or drop database structures such as tables, indexes.
- üõ°Ô∏è **Data Control**: To manage access to data, including user authentication and authorization.
- üìà **Data Analysis**: To perform complex queries and data analysis tasks.
- üîó **Data Integration**: To combine data from multiple sources into a single database.
- üíæ **Data Backup and Recovery**: To create backups of the database and recover data in case of loss.
- üîí **Data Security**: To ensure the integrity and security of the data.
- üßæ **Data Auditing**: To track and monitor changes to the data.
- üßÆ **Data Reporting**: To generate reports based on the data.
- üß† **Data Mining**: To discover patterns and relationships in the data.
- üè¢ **Data Warehousing**: To create a centralized repository of data for analysis and reporting.
- üöö **Data Migrations**: To move data from one database to another.

## üåê SQL used in the following areas 

- **üë®‚Äçüî¨ Data Scientist**
- **üìä Data Analyst**
- **üõ†Ô∏è Data Engineer**
- **üíº Business Analyst**
- **üßë‚Äçüíª Database Administrator**

## ‚ùì What is Data?

**Answer:**  
Everything can be considered as **data**. üí°  
For example, any **üè¶ financial institution** has details related to its **üë®‚Äçüíº employees**, **üë• customers**, and their **üí≥ services**.
It can be in any form such as **üìù text**, **üñºÔ∏è images**, **üé• videos**, **üìÑ documents**, or even a single **üî§ character** itself.

# üóÇÔ∏è Types of SQL Commands

SQL commands are categorized into five main types:

---

## üõ†Ô∏è DDL ‚Äì Data Definition Language

Used to define and manage all structures in a database.

| **Command** | **Used For** | **Example** |
|-------------|--------------|-------------|
| `CREATE` üèóÔ∏è | Create new database objects (tables, views, etc.) | `CREATE TABLE employees (id INT, name VARCHAR(100));` |
| `ALTER` üîß | Modify existing database objects | `ALTER TABLE employees ADD email VARCHAR(100);` |
| `DROP` üí£ | Delete database objects completely | `DROP TABLE employees;` |
| `TRUNCATE` üöÆ | Delete all rows from a table quickly | `TRUNCATE TABLE employees;` |

---

## üìù DML ‚Äì Data Manipulation Language

Used to manipulate data in existing tables.

| **Command** | **Used For** | **Example** |
|-------------|--------------|-------------|
| `INSERT` üßæ | Add new data | `INSERT INTO employees (id, name) VALUES (1, 'John');` |
| `UPDATE` ‚úèÔ∏è | Modify existing data | `UPDATE employees SET name = 'Jane' WHERE id = 1;` |
| `DELETE` üóëÔ∏è | Remove data | `DELETE FROM employees WHERE id = 1;` |
| `MERGE` üîÄ | Merge rows from two tables | `MERGE INTO sales USING new_sales ON (sales.id = new_sales.id) WHEN MATCHED THEN UPDATE SET ...` |
| `CALL` ‚òéÔ∏è | Execute stored procedure | `CALL GetEmployeeDetails(1);` |
| `EXPLAIN` üìä | Analyze query performance | `EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM employees;` |
| `LOCK` üîí | Lock table or row | `LOCK TABLE employees IN EXCLUSIVE MODE;` |
| `UNLOCK` üîì | Unlock table or row | _(Varies by DBMS)_ |

---

## üîê DCL ‚Äì Data Control Language

Used to manage permissions and access control.

| **Command** | **Used For** | **Example** |
|-------------|--------------|-------------|
| `GRANT` üéüÔ∏è | Give permissions to users | `GRANT SELECT ON employees TO user1;` |
| `REVOKE` ‚õî | Remove permissions from users | `REVOKE SELECT ON employees FROM user1;` |

---

## üîç DQL ‚Äì Data Query Language

Used to query and retrieve data.

| **Command** | **Used For** | **Example** |
|-------------|--------------|-------------|
| `SELECT` üîé | Retrieve data from tables | `SELECT * FROM employees;` |

---

## üîÑ TCL ‚Äì Transaction Control Language

Used to manage database transactions.

| **Command** | **Used For** | **Example** |
|-------------|--------------|-------------|
| `COMMIT` ‚úÖ | Save all changes made in the transaction | `COMMIT;` |
| `ROLLBACK` ‚ùå | Undo changes since the last commit | `ROLLBACK;` |
| `SAVEPOINT` üõë | Set a savepoint for partial rollbacks | `SAVEPOINT before_update;` |
| `RELEASE` üßπ | Remove a savepoint | `RELEASE SAVEPOINT before_update;` |

# üÜö Difference Between SQL and NoSQL

| Feature | SQL Databases üóÉÔ∏è | NoSQL Databases üåê |
|--------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Data Model** | Relational (tables with rows and columns) | Non-relational (document, key-value, wide-column, graph) |
| **Schema** | Fixed schema (predefined structure) | Dynamic schema (flexible structure) |
| **Scalability** | Vertically scalable (scale-up) | Horizontally scalable (scale-out) |
| **Examples** | MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server | MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, Couchbase |
| **Best For** | Structured data with complex queries | Unstructured or semi-structured data, fast development |
| **Query Language** | SQL (Structured Query Language) | Varies by database (e.g., MongoDB uses JSON-like queries) |
| **Transactions** | Strong ACID compliance | Some support BASE (eventual consistency), limited ACID |
